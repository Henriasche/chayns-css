# chayns® styles

To get started with chayns® styles you only have to add the stylesheet to your tapp.
```HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://chayns-res.tobit.com/API/V3.1/css/chayns.min.css">
```

In order for some special styles to work (i.e. accordions) you need to implement the chayns® script as well.
```HTML
<script src="https://chayns-res.tobit.com/API/V3.1/js/chayns.min.js"></script>
```
For more information you can take a look at our [wiki](https://github.com/TobitSoftware/chayns-css/wiki/).
